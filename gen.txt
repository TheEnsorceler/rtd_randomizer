Outward: affects anything that is not you.
Inward: affects yourself.

Mental: creates a mental effect. Making people believe you don't exist or creating an illusion would count as mental.
Temporary: creates something that lasts for a few minutes at most. Making a fireball or a rune would count as this.

# Lieutenants are very tough enemies. In a videogame, they would be regular bosses. They get two effects.
# Generals are extremely strong enemies. In a videogame, they would be final bosses. They get three effects.
# Roll for effects. Amount of effects depends on rank of enemy.

	[Mood]
Dangerous To Diabetics. Everything and everyone is good! Yay! YAAAY.
Happy. Life's good, really. Optimism is the right path to take, and people are innately good.
Realistic. There's good people, and bad people. Some get rewarded, others don't. The world's worth fighting for, but it's not the best.
Sad. The good guys don't catch a break, and the bad people lap it all up.
Don't Watch This If You Are Feeling Depressed. Reality is a prison and it's a crappy one at that. Everyone is not only evil, but incompetent and insane. Going mad or committing suicide is the only way out.
	[Ending]
Complete Happy Ending: Everyone goes away happy, even the villain is redeemed.
Happy Ending: Those who deserved their punishment got it, and the heroes get rewarded.
Bittersweet Ending: They completed their mission, but at what cost? Perhaps the villain got away. Maybe the person they wanted to save died. But at least the villains were stopped.
Grim Ending: Nothing's improved, but at least the good guys got away.
Sad Ending: the good guys are either dead or might as well be, but at least they did so while happy.
Downer Ending: the villains won. The good guys are screwed/dead. What a waste.
Kill Em All: everyone's dead. Everyone, villain and hero alike. Maybe one person walks away from all this if you're lucky.

[Scavenging]
"Use this for when running a post-apocalyptic/non-economic area game."
Trash: Useless at the current time. May have been useful a long, long time ago, but it isn't anymore. Cannot be used for anything but crafting. Examples of this would be rubber bands,  individual nails, human teeth, or bullet casings.
Junk: Broken pieces of crap. It's not great at it's job at all, but it's better then nothing. Can be used with a major penalty to any actions associated with it. Examples of this would be a rifle missing it's bolt-action, a car without an engine, or a rusted lock.
Improvised: Not great, but not bad either. Doesn't provide any interesting things one way or another. Usually improvised items that are surprisingly good at their job. Can be used without any modifiers. Examples of this would be a high-quality zipgun, a paper clip serving as a lockpick, or a grenade made out of a tin-can and some fireworks.
Quality: Primo! Good thing you found this. Usually these are pre-apocalypse pieces of equipment. Can be used with a bonus to use. Examples of this would be a pristine Dodge Challenger, a military-grade assault rifle, or a professional lockpick kit.
